# biol4100_sp2025

This is the central landing place for all things related to BIOL 4100-029: Undergraduate Research.

This course focuses on understanding the approaches and techniques needed to examine plant physiological responses and feedbacks to the environment. The specific tools taught will be dependent on student interest and decided during the first class meeting period, but may include literature review, experimental design, and measurements of plant gas exchange and environmental manipulation. Students will also learn about best practices for data cleaning and management, analysis, and dissemination. The course is designed to be broad and catered to student interest; however, weekly readings will be related to ongoing projects in the Smith Plant Ecophysiology Lab focused on understanding plant ecophysiological responses to disturbance (e.g., due to climate change or plant invasion).
